## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: Underestimating Complexity

**Problem**: Viewing DORA as just another compliance exercise
**Solution**: Treat DORA as strategic transformation, not checklist compliance

### Pitfall 2: Insufficient Budget/Resources

**Problem**: Underfunding DORA implementation
**Solution**: Conduct thorough cost assessment, build business case, secure executive commitment

### Pitfall 3: Lack of Board Engagement

**Problem**: Board treats DORA as IT issue
**Solution**: Board training, regular reporting, frame as business resilience (not just IT)

### Pitfall 4: Incomplete Third-Party Register

**Problem**: Missing or inaccurate register of ICT providers
**Solution**: Comprehensive discovery process, procurement coordination, regular updates

### Pitfall 5: Contract Renegotiation Delays

**Problem**: Providers slow to agree to DORA clauses
**Solution**: Start early, prioritize critical providers, consider alternatives if provider refuses

### Pitfall 6: Inadequate Incident Classification

**Problem**: Misclassifying incidents (major vs. non-major)
**Solution**: Clear, documented criteria; risk/compliance involvement; err on side of reporting

### Pitfall 7: Unrealistic Testing Scope

**Problem**: Testing program too limited or too ambitious
**Solution**: Risk-based prioritization, phased approach, leverage external expertise

### Pitfall 8: Siloed Implementation

**Problem**: IT/security implementing DORA without business involvement
**Solution**: Cross-functional steering committee, business unit engagement, shared ownership

### Pitfall 9: Documentation Gaps

**Problem**: Controls implemented but not documented
**Solution**: Documentation discipline, centralized repository, regular reviews

### Pitfall 10: "Set and Forget" Mentality

**Problem**: Treating DORA as one-time project
**Solution**: Continuous monitoring, regular updates, embed in BAU processes

## DORA and Related Regulations

### Interaction with Other EU Regulations

**GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**:

- DORA complements GDPR
- GDPR: Data protection and privacy
- DORA: Digital operational resilience
- Overlap: Data breach notification, security controls
- Coordination: DORA incident reporting does not replace GDPR breach notification (both may apply)

**NIS2 Directive (Network and Information Security Directive)**:

- NIS2 applies to broader set of entities (including some financial)
- DORA is lex specialis for financial sector (takes precedence)
- Financial entities under DORA not subject to NIS2
- Similar requirements: Risk management, incident reporting, supply chain security

**MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation)**:

- MiCA regulates crypto-asset service providers (CASPs)
- DORA applies to CASPs
- MiCA has specific requirements for CASPs; DORA adds operational resilience layer

**EMIR/SFTR (Derivatives and Securities Financing Transactions)**:

- DORA complements with operational resilience requirements
- CCPs, trade repositories subject to both EMIR and DORA

### Alignment with International Standards

**ISO 27001**: Information security management

- DORA aligns with ISO 27001 principles
- ISO certification helpful but not sufficient for DORA compliance

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework**:

- DORA's risk management framework similar to NIST CSF
- Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover

**TIBER-EU**:

- DORA explicitly adopts TIBER-EU for TLPT
- Harmonized threat-led testing across EU

**SWIFT Customer Security Programme (CSP)**:

- Banks using SWIFT also subject to CSP
- DORA and SWIFT CSP complementary
- Some overlap in controls (reduce duplication)
