## Current FedRAMP State (as of August 2026 — CR26)

> ⚠️ **CR26 (FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026)**: FedRAMP has restructured its authorization framework. FIPS 199-based baseline labels (Low/Moderate/High/LI-SaaS) are replaced with **Certification Classes A–D** (per notice NTC-0004; CR26 rules valid through December 31, 2028). Class labels change the *names* of the baselines, not their requirements. CSPs already authorized under the old labels retain their authorization through a transition period in which old and new labels are linked.

- **Baseline**: NIST SP 800-53 **Rev 5** (fully in effect)
- **Control counts** (Rev 5): Low ≈ 156, Moderate = 323, High = 421 (legacy references; CR26 class-based counts being published by PMO)
- **CR26 Certification Classes** (official mapping, NTC-0004): **A** = new pilot/transitional baseline (entry via external frameworks such as SOC 2 Type II through Program Certification; holders have a 2-year window to obtain B/C/D), **B** = current **LI-SaaS + Low** baselines, **C** = current **Moderate** baseline (majority of federal deployments, incl. CUI), **D** = current **High** baseline.
- **FedRAMP 20x**: Now the **primary authorization pathway** — continuous authorization built on **Key Security Indicators (KSIs)**, machine-readable evidence, modular API-driven submissions, and automated validation. Traditional SSP/SAP/SAR templates remain for legacy paths.
- **CR26 status**: finalized **June 25, 2026**; optional early adoption since **July 4, 2026**; **mandatory January 1, 2027**.
- **Legacy FedRAMP Ready**: the Ready designation was retired/relabeled **Legacy FedRAMP Ready on July 28, 2026** — no new submissions. Rev5 Ready holders must convert by the later of their annual-assessment expiration or **November 17, 2026**; the status disappears entirely **December 31, 2027**.
- **Certification Class pipelines**: **Class A open since August 3, 2026**; Classes **B/C open August 31, 2026**; Class D pilot expected late 2026 with a formal option in early 2027.
- **Rev5 wind-down**: new Rev5 applications are not accepted after **June 11, 2027**; Rev5 sunsets **December 31, 2028**.
- **JAB P-ATO**: Fully suspended; FedRAMP PMO is the sole authorization body.
- **Machine-readable mandate (RFC-0024/NOTICE-0009, operationalized in CR26)** — applies to the **Rev5 process only, explicitly NOT to FedRAMP 20x**: from **2PM ET September 30, 2026**, NEW Rev5 initial-certification packages must be machine-readable with **no grace period** (including packages already In Process for agency authorization) [LMR-GEN-ICR]; existing Rev5-certified providers must submit a full machine-readable package at **each annual assessment completed after that date** [LMR-GEN-OAR]. Approved formats: **NIST OSCAL, or any public-domain standardized format that 5+ certified CSPs agree to maintain** (FedRAMP-validated); CR26 JSON schemas and a validator are published. Human-readable versions must still be produced on request. Non-compliance: public notification until **2PM ET September 30, 2027**, then **certification revocation**.
- **Security Inbox**: All authorized CSPs must maintain a dedicated Security Inbox (no CAPTCHAs or barriers) for urgent vulnerability directives — effective January 5, 2026.
- **Key templates updated**: SSP, SAR, SAP, POA&M, CIS/CRM, IIW, ISCP — all updated to align with Rev 5 (Dec 2024 releases).

## 1. Readiness & Gap Assessment

### Approach
1. **Clarify scope** — Ask the user: What is the CSO (Cloud Service Offering)? IaaS/PaaS/SaaS? Target Certification Class under CR26?
2. **Identify authorization path** — FedRAMP 20x (primary, preferred) vs. legacy Agency Authorization package (still available for complex systems during CR26 transition)
3. **Run through the readiness checklist** — See `references/readiness-checklist.md`
4. **Surface gaps** — Map current state to required controls; flag missing documentation, unimplemented controls, and architectural deficiencies
5. **Prioritize** — Group gaps by: (a) blockers for readiness review, (b) items addressable before 3PAO assessment, (c) POA&M candidates

> **FedRAMP Ready retired July 28, 2026** (now "Legacy FedRAMP Ready"). Advise CSPs by pipeline instead: Class A (open since August 3, 2026) for external-framework entry, Classes B/C from August 31, 2026 for full certification; legacy Rev5 Ready holders must convert by the later of annual-assessment expiration or November 17, 2026.

### Key Readiness Questions to Ask the User
- Are you targeting FedRAMP 20x (preferred) or a legacy authorization package?
- What cloud platform (AWS GovCloud, Azure Government, GCP, on-prem hybrid)?
- Are you leveraging any existing FedRAMP-authorized IaaS/PaaS (e.g., AWS GovCloud FedRAMP High)?
- Do you have FIPS 140-2/3 validated encryption in place?
- Is your authorization boundary defined and documented?
- Do you have a vulnerability scanning program (OS, DB, web app, container)?
- Are security policies and procedures documented?
- Do you have an Incident Response Plan (IRP) and Contingency Plan (CP) that have been tested?
- Are your Rev5 authorization package artifacts machine-readable (OSCAL or an approved format)? Mandatory for new Rev5 packages from Sept 30, 2026; for existing providers at the next annual assessment after that date. (20x has its own machine-readable model.)

### Output Format
- Produce a **gap table**: Control Family | Current State | Gap | Priority | Owner
- Summarize top 5–10 high-priority gaps as prose
- Note the target Certification Class and whether FedRAMP 20x is feasible

## 2. ATO Documentation

The core FedRAMP authorization package consists of:

```
Authorization Package
├── System Security Plan (SSP) + Appendices A–Q
├── Security Assessment Plan (SAP) + Appendices A–D  [3PAO-prepared]
├── Security Assessment Report (SAR) + Appendices A–F  [3PAO-prepared]
└── Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)  [SSP Appendix O]
```

> **Important**: Word/Excel templates are being retired for Rev5 — new Rev5 packages must be machine-readable (OSCAL or approved format) from September 30, 2026; existing providers convert at their next annual assessment. Human-readable renditions on request.
> Templates: https://www.fedramp.gov/documents-templates/

### Document Guidance

For detailed guidance on each document type, read the appropriate reference file:

- **SSP** → `references/ssp-guide.md`
- **POA&M** → `references/poam-guide.md`
- **SAP / SAR** → `references/sap-sar-guide.md`
- **Supporting appendices** → `references/appendices-guide.md`

### General Writing Principles for All ATO Docs
1. **Describe only what is implemented** — Do not document planned or aspirational controls; these trigger findings and must go in POA&M instead
2. **Be specific** — Reference exact tools, filenames, section numbers, policy names; vague language causes findings
3. **Mind the verbs** — Each control requirement uses specific verbs (track, document, enforce, test). Address each verb explicitly
4. **Shared responsibility** — For any customer-configurable or shared control, create a clear "Customer Responsibility" section
5. **Keep it consistent** — Architecture diagrams, data flows, inventory, and control statements must all be internally consistent

## 3. NIST 800-53 Control Mapping

### Control Families (Rev 5)

| ID | Family | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AC | Access Control | IAM, RBAC, least privilege, remote access |
| AT | Awareness & Training | Security + **privacy** training (new in Rev 5) |
| AU | Audit & Accountability | Log retention, SIEM, audit review |
| CA | Assessment, Authorization & Monitoring | ConMon, 3PAO, ATO |
| CM | Configuration Management | Baselines, change control, CMDB |
| CP | Contingency Planning | BCP/DR, tested annually |
| IA | Identification & Authentication | MFA, PIV, FIPS 140-2/3 crypto |
| IR | Incident Response | IRP, tested annually, reporting SLAs |
| MA | Maintenance | Remote maintenance controls |
| MP | Media Protection | Data at rest, media sanitization |
| PE | Physical & Environmental | Datacenters; often inherited from IaaS |
| PL | Planning | SSP, rules of behavior |
| PM | Program Management | Enterprise-level security program |
| PS | Personnel Security | Screening, termination procedures |
| PT | PII Processing & Transparency | **New family in Rev 5** — privacy controls |
| RA | Risk Assessment | Vulnerability scanning, MITRE ATT&CK scoring |
| SA | System & Services Acquisition | SDLC, supply chain |
| SC | System & Communications Protection | Encryption in transit, network segmentation |
| SI | System & Information Integrity | Patching, malware, integrity monitoring |
| SR | Supply Chain Risk Management | **New family in Rev 5** — SCRM |

### CR26 Certification Class Mapping

Under CR26, the FedRAMP PMO is aligning control baselines to Certification Classes. When users describe their system, map to a class:

- **Class A** (Pilot/Transitional): New baseline introduced under 20x — entry into the federal market via external frameworks (initially SOC 2 Type II) through Program Certification; Class A holders have a **2-year window** to obtain a Class B, C, or D certification through full assessment
- **Class B** (replaces LI-SaaS + Low): Systems handling non-sensitive federal information where a breach would cause limited harm
- **Class C** (replaces Moderate): Most common — the majority of federal cloud deployments, including systems handling CUI
- **Class D** (replaces High): Federal information where compromise has severe or catastrophic effect (e.g., law enforcement, financial, health data)

> **Legacy references**: Many existing FedRAMP documents still reference Low/Moderate/High/LI-SaaS. These map to **LI-SaaS/Low → Class B, Moderate → Class C, High → Class D** (Class A is new — it has no legacy equivalent). During the CR26 transition, old and new labels are linked. Advise CSPs to check fedramp.gov for the latest.

### Mapping Workflow
1. Ask: What types of federal data will the system process/store/transmit?
2. Determine target Certification Class (A, B, C, or D) under CR26
3. Select NIST 800-53 Rev 5 baseline using the class mapping (B ↔ Low, C ↔ Moderate, D ↔ High)
4. Cross-reference with FedRAMP parameter requirements (FedRAMP often sets stricter parameters than base NIST)
5. For inherited controls, identify which are fully/partially inherited from leveraged FedRAMP IaaS/PaaS and document in CIS/CRM workbook

### Rev 4 → Rev 5 Key Changes to Highlight
- **New control families**: PT (Privacy), SR (Supply Chain)
- **Password controls revised**: No more forced rotation schedules; requires compromised-password lists and password strength meters (NIST 800-63b alignment)
- **Privacy integrated**: AT-3 now mandates privacy training; many families have privacy-specific enhancements
- **Threat-based methodology**: MITRE ATT&CK framework informs control prioritization

---

## 4. Architecture Guidance

### Authorization Boundary
The boundary defines what is IN scope for FedRAMP. This is one of the most common sources of findings and delays.

Key principles:
- **Everything that processes, stores, or transmits federal data** must be inside the boundary
- External services connected to in-scope systems must be FedRAMP-authorized OR documented with compensating controls
- Boundary must be depicted in a clear **network/data flow diagram** (required in SSP)

### Cloud Platform Considerations

**AWS GovCloud (US)**
- AWS GovCloud is FedRAMP High authorized — most PE and some SC controls are fully inherited
- Use AWS Config, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub to satisfy AU, RA, SI controls
- Ensure use of GovCloud region endpoints (not standard commercial) to stay in boundary
- FIPS endpoints available for IA controls

**Azure Government**
- Azure Government is FedRAMP High authorized
- Azure Policy + Defender for Cloud maps well to CM, RA, SI
- Use Azure Blueprints / Policy Initiatives aligned to FedRAMP Moderate/High

**Google Cloud (FedRAMP-authorized regions)**
- Assured Workloads for FedRAMP compliance
- Chronicle SIEM for AU controls

### Architecture Patterns That Support FedRAMP
- **Zero Trust** — aligns directly with AC, IA, SC control families
- **Immutable infrastructure** — simplifies CM (configuration drift is a common finding)
- **Centralized logging** — SIEM/log aggregation addresses AU family comprehensively
- **Automated vulnerability scanning** — Required; must cover OS, DB, web app, and containers (if used)
- **Machine-readable tooling (OSCAL-native or approved format)** — new Rev5 packages require it from Sept 30, 2026; existing Rev5 providers at the next annual assessment

### Common Architecture Findings
- Undocumented external connections leaving the boundary
- FIPS-non-compliant encryption algorithms in transit or at rest
- Overly broad IAM roles / lack of least privilege
- Missing MFA on privileged accounts
- Vulnerability scans not covering all boundary components
- Logging gaps (not all components sending logs to centralized SIEM)
- Rev5 packages not yet machine-readable ahead of the Sept 30, 2026 intake cutoff (or the provider's first post-cutoff annual assessment)

---

## 5. Continuous Monitoring

Once authorized, CSPs must maintain compliance through ConMon activities:

### Monthly Requirements
- Vulnerability scan results submitted to agency AOs
- POA&M updates (open findings, remediation progress)
- Inventory updates (new/removed assets)
- ConMon Monthly Executive Summary (template updated Nov 2024)

### Annual Requirements
- Full security assessment by 3PAO using Annual Assessment Controls Selection Worksheet
- Updated SSP and appendices
- Tested IRP and CP
- SAR and updated POA&M

### POA&M Management
- All open findings must have: risk level, owner, milestone dates, remediation plan
- Vendor Dependencies (VDs): when a finding depends on a third-party fix — document and track
- Deviation Requests (DRs): false positives and risk adjustments require AO approval
- SLA for remediation (FedRAMP ConMon Performance Management Guide): **High = 30 days**, **Moderate = 90 days**, **Low = 180 days** from identification. Where Critical is distinguished from High (e.g., scanner ratings), treat it as High-or-stricter (≤30 days, prioritized immediately)

## Output Formatting Guide

Match output format to request type:

| Request Type | Preferred Format |
|---|---|
| Gap assessment | Table + prose summary |
| SSP control narrative | Prose paragraphs (one per control/enhancement) |
| POA&M entry | Structured table row with all required fields |
| Architecture review | Bullet findings + recommended remediations |
| Control mapping question | Table: Control ID \| Requirement \| How to Implement |
| Readiness overview | Executive summary prose + priority action list |

When generating document content, always note: *"Use official FedRAMP templates from fedramp.gov — this content should be inserted into the appropriate template section."*
